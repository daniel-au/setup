# ReadMe

This is a collection of things for my personal computer setup. As of right now, there's a setup script that installs things via the command line. It mostly leverages homebrew to manage everything.

## Dotfiles
There's also a collection dotfiles. They're here so I can  access them from wherever. In order to maintain this repo, I had to create hard links from the dotfiles in this folder to the actual locations the dotfiles belong.
